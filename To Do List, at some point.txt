To add after Leviathan, in no particular order... yea after the leviathan ordeal probably going to be a long time before I get to any of this.
   - Added Caucasian religion group for Khaldic and Armazic (I could possibly put them in a group with Zoroastrian)
   - Added an as of yet unnamed group for Magyar, Zalmoxian and Scythian. (yes I know that these religions aren't exactly related, I'm more so doing it because of their proximaty to each other, while being rather different to most of the neighbouring pagans. Future me (from when I wrote that, anyway, past me now) says that I could just leave em separate, nothing set in stone yet.
   - Add Khaldic, Armazic, Scythian, Magyar and Nuragic religions
   
   - Possibly do some estate stuff, Warrior Bands for Germanics, Druids for Celts, that sort of thing (could just have the base estates have unique names and privileges when the nation is pagan)
   - Get around to doing some events
    - Have the Jews return to Jerusalem during the Pagan Wrath (yes that's what the event following the resurgence is known as), the owner can then either choose to persecute, accept, let them become a vassal (as Israel) or choose to have them be independant, for the last option the player can get the choice to play as them.
