Hello and welcome to Pagan Wrath. (yes I copied my steam description lol)

In order to start the Pagan Resurgence it is pretty simple, just activate the decision and wait about how many years you selected, once the time has passed events will fire placing Pagan Centers of Resurgence in various cultures pertaining to the Religion. (Once 0.5 drops)

Currently I don't have too much flavor beyond some Personal Deities but I plan to add more flavor in the future, feel free to suggest ideas as well.

Thanks to neo for helping me fix some issues regarding CoRs not showing up.

Integrated into this mod for quite a few vanilla religions is reddbane's [URL=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=926336924] Historical Religious Colours (Colourblind Friendly) [/URL] 

I have also taken some assets from Shattered Universalis and Extended Timeline (no I'm not going to make an ET or even Vanilla version for this, others can feel free to do so though, as long as you link back here.)
