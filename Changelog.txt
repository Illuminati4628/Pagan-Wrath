Version 0.5.1

 Changes
  - Changed German to Tuistic


Version 0.5

 Bug Fixes
  - Fixed newly spawned CoRs not having the Religious Zeal Modifier (how did this go unnoticed for so long?)
  - If this bug was in a released version; fixed the New World Pagans and Norse not being in the correct groups.
  - (Re)restored Buryatia, when I performed my history file update I accidently killed them, sorry about that.

 Changes
  - Cleaned up the changelog.
  - Completely changed how centers of resurgence appear, rather than appearing in set areas they can now appear on any respective culture/group as long as it's on the correct continent. This means if a player manages to wipe out a culture/culture group before the CoR spawns that religion can no longer appear. Though that probably won't happen... unless you're Vlindemann
  - Renamed Druidic to Gaelic and tweaked its colour to be less similar to the Muslims
  - Renamed Arabic (the pagan religion) to Wathanist
  - Renamed Slavic to Prabohnic (more on this in additions)
  
 Additions
  - Added Celtiberic and Gallic (Now France and Iberia can get in on the fun! Although they are pretty much different coloured druidics for now.)
  - Added Sudunic and Rodunic, splitting up the Slavic pagans into East, West and South, allowing for more centers of reformation to match up with the other groups. I named them after the supreme god for now, but if anyone comes up with something better I will likely change it.
    - This means that Prabohnic now has the same Expansion events, giving it 3 CoRs, hopefully this will counterbalance the crazy Romuva I've seen fairly often.
  - Made provinces that neighbour newly spawned CoRs more susceptical to the CoRs

  
Version 0.4

Bug Fixes
 - Stopped Hellenic centers trying to appear in Anatolia (different continent so it won't work, blame pdx)
 
Changes 

 - Renamed Suomenusko to Finnic. (It meant something around Finland Religion)
 - Split Suomenusko into Finnic in and around Finland and Uralic in the Urals
 - Split Old World and New World Pagans
	- Changed Animists in new world to Ritualist
 - Added ability to toggle off Cthulhu
 - Moved the Tengri resurgence zone from the Western Steppe to the Central Asian Steppe. Of course a player can still change regardless. 
	- It's just how the game mechanics work, if I could I would extend to the Central Asian Steppe rather then moving.
Misc	
 - Did a bunch of other things but because I'm less organised than even Draiocht I don't remember what they are... sorry
 - Changed province histories to only overwrite religion instead of all provincial information, using the technique discovered by Perry (unfortunately I killed Buryatia by accident here, but they are back in 0.5!)

Version 0.3

 Changes

  - Rebalanced religious spread to follow the spread of respective cultures more closely (Zalmoxian should appear in south Slavic provinces far less now for example)
  - Changed the Hellenic religion to only spawn in Greece, Thrace, The Aegean coastline and the Marmara Sea Coastline (yea those last bits should only have been on the European side)
  - Changed the Latin religion to be able to spawn all across Italy except for the Rome area because Papacy
  - Allowed Sunnis to convert to Hellenic for those wierdos who want to become Hellenic Ottomans

 Additions  
  - Added an event to force convert nations or have negative consequences
  - Options to toggle the different religions at the start of the game
  - Options to have the resurgence start in 10 or 50 years, along with the initial 100 years
  - Tengri Resurgence in the western steppe
