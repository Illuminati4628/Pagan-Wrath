Version 0.7.1.0
  Bug Fixes
   - Fixed missing localisation for some modifiers

Version 0.7.0.2

  Additions
   -    
Version 0.7.0.1

  Bug Fixes

  Changes
   -
  Additions
   - Added new Kemetic and Celtic religion sounds courtesy of ComradDoge | Shattered Europa

Version 0.6.3.0

  Bug Fixes
   - I'm not sure if there were any, I'm horrible with organising sometimes
   - Probably introduced some... keep an eye out for em, they are jerks and say mean things, such as; "Hey snail, you're shell looks like a rabbit puked on a turd!" Just really mean guys honestly.
  
  Changes
   - Changed expansion events MTTH from 10 years up to 25, this should make it so that there may not be 3 CoRs from the events, but nations converting may still spawn them
   - Pagan Expansion events are no longer considered major, it was getting way too spammy
   - Renamed Tengri to Uighur and moved it from the pagan group into a new Tengri group, with Turkic
   - Moved Shamanist to the new Tengri group and renamed it to Siberian, also recoloured it to be an icy blue
   - Reworked Pagan Spread to only spread to provinces outside of their home region (area their centres can spawn in) if the province is from the expected culture or owned by a nation following that religion, i.e. Anglic will only spread into Ireland if it has been converted to a culture in the British Group or England already owns it whilst being Anglic
    - Also reworked the spread to no longer effect other pagans, unless the pagans are heretics
  Additions
   - Added Turkic Religion
   - Added Tengri religion group for Turkic and Uighur

Version 0.6.2

   - Fixed diety icons because I can't count apparantly

Version STRENG GEHEIM
  - Did something horrible

Version 0.6.1

  Bug Fixes
   - Fixed Establish Official Religious Authority decision being repeatable
   - Fixed Celtic faiths missing holy war name
   - Fixed Gallic, Celtiberic, Sudunic and Rodunic not having proper conversion options, meaning you couldn't convert to them (may have been fixed in the last update but I forgot to note it so here it is)

Version 0.6.0

  Bug Fixes
   - While probably not noticed for English users, fixed missing or outdated localisation in the French, German and Spanish files, though note these are still in English
   
  Changes
   - Tweaked the adopt Apotheosian decision to convert provinces that have either have or neighbour 30 dev provinces, down from 40

  Additions
   - Added 7 new personal deities to Apotheosian, though they aren't dieties in the traditional sense, more so what the current ruler is going to ascend to.
   - Added 4 new personal deities to Canaanite, now they have 6 like most other pagans, though currently icons are placeholder
   - Added decision for Christians to convert to Apotheosian after the Apotheosian Dominance event occurs through the decision.

Version 0.5.3

  Bug Fixes
   - Fixed missing Rodunic and Sudunic CoRs
   - Fixed Gaelic CoRs potentially spawning in Lower Brittany
   - Localised Gallic and Celtiberic CoRs
   - Hopefully fixed the Expansion Event spam
   
  Changes
   - Changed events to not spawn CoRs in provinces with religious centers  

Version 0.5.2

  Bug Fixes
   - Fixed crash when opening cathar religion screen when running heresy
   - Hopefully fixed certain religions not spawning until after a reload
   - Fixed scrolling in the decision menu getting locked when opening the toggle menu, by deleting them
   
  Changes
   - Reverted religions spawn via cultures back to using preset regions, not sure why past me ever decided to change something that was working fine...
   - Changed the religion toggles from decisions to event menus


Version 0.5.1

 Changes
  - Changed German to Tuistic


Version 0.5

 Bug Fixes
  - Fixed newly spawned CoRs not having the Religious Zeal Modifier (how did this go unnoticed for so long?)
  - If this bug was in a released version; fixed the New World Pagans and Norse not being in the correct groups.
  - (Re)restored Buryatia, when I performed my history file update I accidently killed them, sorry about that.

 Changes
  - Cleaned up the changelog.
  - Completely changed how centers of resurgence appear, rather than appearing in set areas they can now appear on any respective culture/group as long as it's on the correct continent. This means if a player manages to wipe out a culture/culture group before the CoR spawns that religion can no longer appear. 
  - Renamed Druidic to Gaelic and tweaked its colour to be less similar to the Muslims
  - Renamed Arabic (the pagan religion) to Wathanist
  - Renamed Slavic to Prabohnic (more on this in additions)
  
 Additions
  - Added Celtiberic and Gallic (Now France and Iberia can get in on the fun! Although they are pretty much different coloured druidics for now.)
  - Added Sudunic and Rodunic, splitting up the Slavic pagans into East, West and South, allowing for more centers of reformation to match up with the other groups. I named them after the supreme god for now, but if anyone comes up with something better I will likely change it.
    - This means that Prabohnic now has the same Expansion events, giving it 3 CoRs, hopefully this will counterbalance the crazy Romuva I've seen fairly often.
  - Made provinces that neighbour newly spawned CoRs more susceptical to the CoRs

  
Version 0.4

Bug Fixes
 - Stopped Hellenic centers trying to appear in Anatolia (different continent so it won't work, blame pdx)
 
Changes 

 - Renamed Suomenusko to Finnic. (It meant something around Finland Religion)
 - Split Suomenusko into Finnic in and around Finland and Uralic in the Urals
 - Split Old World and New World Pagans
	- Changed Animists in new world to Ritualist
 - Added ability to toggle off Cthulhu
 - Moved the Tengri resurgence zone from the Western Steppe to the Central Asian Steppe. Of course a player can still change regardless. 
	- It's just how the game mechanics work, if I could I would extend to the Central Asian Steppe rather then moving.
Misc	
 - Did a bunch of other things but because I'm less organised than even Draiocht I don't remember what they are... sorry
 - Changed province histories to only overwrite religion instead of all provincial information, using the technique discovered by Perry (unfortunately I killed Buryatia by accident here, but they are back in 0.5!)

Version 0.3

 Changes

  - Rebalanced religious spread to follow the spread of respective cultures more closely (Zalmoxian should appear in south Slavic provinces far less now for example)
  - Changed the Hellenic religion to only spawn in Greece, Thrace, The Aegean coastline and the Marmara Sea Coastline (yea those last bits should only have been on the European side)
  - Changed the Latin religion to be able to spawn all across Italy except for the Rome area because Papacy
  - Allowed Sunnis to convert to Hellenic for those wierdos who want to become Hellenic Ottomans

 Additions  
  - Added an event to force convert nations or have negative consequences
  - Options to toggle the different religions at the start of the game
