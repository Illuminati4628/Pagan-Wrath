Version 0.4 - Fixes, edits and more stuff
Renamed Suomenusko to Finnic. (It meant something around Finland Religion)
Split Suomenusko into Finnic in and around Finland and Uralic in the Urals
Split Old World and New World Pagans
	-Changed Animists in new world to Ritualist
Added ability to toggle off Cthulhu
Stopped Hellenic centers trying to appear in Anatolia (different continent so it won't work, blame pdx)
Moved Tengri into its own group and moved the resurgence zone from the Western Steppe to the Central Asian Steppe. Of course a player can still change regardless. 
	-It's just how the game mechanics work, if I could I would extend to the Central Asian Steppe rather then moving.
    -Warning might be a bit buggy, please to report if centers of reformation don't appear and provinces randomly change to Tengri.
Did a bunch of other things but because I'm less organised than even Draiocht I don't remember what they are... sorry
