Version 0.9.1.0
  Additions
   - Added East African religions courtesy of Africa Universalis
  Changes
   - Rebalanced Tuistic and Ænglic personal deities, less military stuff.
  Bug Fixes
   - Fixed religious school events firing between Muslim and Germanic schools
   

Version 0.9.0.1
  Bug Fixes
   - Fixed a province in Tunisia having the wrong religion
   
Version 0.9
  Additions
   - Consider this more a beta patch more then a complete release
   - Updated for BT15
   - Added African pagan religions, these are not yet fully complete but should serve as enough of a difference for the continent until further overhauls are done, similar to the South American Pajelança and Polynesian Tapu
	- Currently these all just use the former fetishist cults and get the same events
  Changes
   - Relocalised Alcheringa to Dreamtime as the former isn't really a well known name and the latter is only really used by a small group in Central Australia (though getting an all encompassing Aboriginal name would be impossible due to how diverse the Aboriginals are)
  Bug Fixes
   - Fixed Brethren giving 75% Heavy Ship Combat ability instead of the intended 7.5%. Opps.

Version 0.8.01
  Additions
   - 
  Changes
   - Tweaked a canaanite deity bonus
  Bug Fixes
   - Fixed Tonga not being in the new polynesian religion
   
Version 0.8.0.0
   - Updated to BT14

  Additions
   - Apotheosian uses the Totemist ancestor worship feature for Leviathan users
   - Added Brethren pirate religion, uses the Islamic Schools effects
   - Added Secular 'religion' which can be obtained in the age of revolutions, uses buffed harmony mechanics.
   - Added the Islamic schools feature to Germanic religions, using their own modifiers of course, this is to be expanded further for certain cultures such as saxon and scottish, though I don't have icons or ideas for modifiers for these yet.
   - Added Romaic religion to the Hellenic group, has Harmony mechanic that allows you to pick dieties from harmonised religions. This is basically a tolerance path as opposed to the neutral regular hellenic and the conversion based Apotheosian.
   - Added Druid estate to Celtic Religions and Warrior Band estate to Germanic Religions, Druids focus on converting heathens while the Warrior Bands focus on fighting, I plan to give an estate to all the new religion groups in time (Note that events are very barebones at the moment for these estates) 
   - Added Championship of Warriors Event set available with a Warrior Bands privilege, if you are familiar with the Byzantine Resurgence Chariot Races it is similar to that

  Changes
   - Pagan religions now spread out from neighbouring provinces of CoRs rather then randomly within the range of them, should result in a little less messy spread 
   - Removed the expansion of X religion events, I feel these were too, well, clunky
   - Revamped the effects upon changing a religion to work a little more like how changing to Cathar in 'Heresy!' addon is.
   - Renamed Uralic to Turumic and Finnic to Ukonusko
   - Tweaked Anglic to Ænglic
   - Added a -3 Tolerance of heathens to Apotheosian, to drive the conversion emphasis up.
   - Changed Canaanite deity modifiers and icons. Icon art courtesy of Transfurom
   - Changed the icon for the Islamic schools to be a little more neutral, as other religions are also using it.
   
  Bug Fixes
   - Properly fixed the bugged claim Mandate CB for the Tengrism group
   - Fixed missing localisation for some modifiers
   - Fixed a Canaanite Deity not giving a build time reduction modifier.  

Version 0.7.0.1

  Bug Fixes
   - Turkic religion not spawning correctly.
   - Fixed Tengri Group nations not getting the claim Mandate CB. (Yes this does mean that a Turkic ottomans could claim the mandate if they somehow end up bordering China)
  Changes
   -
  Additions
   - Added new Kemetic and Celtic religion sounds courtesy of ComradDoge | Shattered Europa
  
Version 0.7.0.0

  Bug Fixes
   - Various Vanilla religions not having sounds because PDX.
   - Turkic religion not having sounds because Illuminati.
   - Fixed missing missionaries (as in the guy on the map when you're converting provinces) for Tengri and New World pagan groups
   
  Changes   
   - Reworked Ritualist into Pajelança
   - Reworked Plenty of religion country modifiers (many were duplicates or a little OP, one of them had bloody 20% discipline wtf why did I do that)
   - Changed the placeholder deity icon to be a little cleaner.
  Additions
   - Added Personal Deities for Pajelança
   - Added Admapu religion for Patagonia
   - Added Zemi religion for the Caribbean Islands and nearby coastal South America
   
Version 0.6.3.1

  Bug Fixes
   - Fixed Rodunic and Sudunic using the wrong icons

Version 0.6.3.0

  Bug Fixes
   - I'm not sure if there were any, I'm horrible with organising sometimes
   - Probably introduced some... keep an eye out for em, they are jerks and say mean things, such as; "Hey snail, you're shell looks like a rabbit puked on a turd!" Just really mean guys honestly.
  
  Changes
   - Changed expansion events MTTH from 10 years up to 25, this should make it so that there may not be 3 CoRs from the events, but nations converting may still spawn them
   - Pagan Expansion events are no longer considered major, it was getting way too spammy
   - Renamed Tengri to Uighur and moved it from the pagan group into a new Tengri group, with Turkic
   - Moved Shamanist to the new Tengri group and renamed it to Siberian, also recoloured it to be an icy blue
   - Reworked Pagan Spread to only spread to provinces outside of their home region (area their centres can spawn in) if the province is from the expected culture or owned by a nation following that religion, i.e. Anglic will only spread into Ireland if it has been converted to a culture in the British Group or England already owns it whilst being Anglic
    - Also reworked the spread to no longer effect other pagans, unless the pagans are heretics
  Additions
   - Added Turkic Religion
   - Added Tengri religion group for Turkic and Uighur

Version 0.6.2
  
  Bug Fixes
   - Fixed toggle for Celtiberic and Gallic not actually disabling the religions
   - Fixed diety icons because I can't count apparantly

Version STRENG GEHEIM
  - Did something horrible

Version 0.6.1

  Bug Fixes
   - Fixed Establish Official Religious Authority decision being repeatable
   - Fixed Celtic faiths missing holy war name
   - Fixed Gallic, Celtiberic, Sudunic and Rodunic not having proper conversion options, meaning you couldn't convert to them (may have been fixed in the last update but I forgot to note it so here it is)

Version 0.6.0

  Bug Fixes
   - While probably not noticed for English users, fixed missing or outdated localisation in the French, German and Spanish files, though note these are still in English
   
  Changes
   - Tweaked the adopt Apotheosian decision to convert provinces that have either have or neighbour 30 dev provinces, down from 40

  Additions
   - Added 7 new personal deities to Apotheosian, though they aren't dieties in the traditional sense, more so what the current ruler is going to ascend to.
   - Added 4 new personal deities to Canaanite, now they have 6 like most other pagans, though currently icons are placeholder
   - Added decision for Christians to convert to Apotheosian after the Apotheosian Dominance event occurs through the decision.

Version 0.5.3

  Bug Fixes
   - Fixed missing Rodunic and Sudunic CoRs
   - Fixed Gaelic CoRs potentially spawning in Lower Brittany
   - Localised Gallic and Celtiberic CoRs
   - Hopefully fixed the Expansion Event spam
   
  Changes
   - Changed events to not spawn CoRs in provinces with religious centers  

Version 0.5.2

  Bug Fixes
   - Fixed crash when opening cathar religion screen when running heresy
   - Hopefully fixed certain religions not spawning until after a reload
   - Fixed scrolling in the decision menu getting locked when opening the toggle menu, by deleting them
   
  Changes
   - Reverted religions spawn via cultures back to using preset regions, not sure why past me ever decided to change something that was working fine...
   - Changed the religion toggles from decisions to event menus


Version 0.5.1

 Changes
  - Changed German to Tuistic


Version 0.5

 Bug Fixes
  - Fixed newly spawned CoRs not having the Religious Zeal Modifier (how did this go unnoticed for so long?)
  - If this bug was in a released version; fixed the New World Pagans and Norse not being in the correct groups.
  - (Re)restored Buryatia, when I performed my history file update I accidently killed them, sorry about that.

 Changes
  - Cleaned up the changelog.
  - Completely changed how centers of resurgence appear, rather than appearing in set areas they can now appear on any respective culture/group as long as it's on the correct continent. This means if a player manages to wipe out a culture/culture group before the CoR spawns that religion can no longer appear. 
  - Renamed Druidic to Gaelic and tweaked its colour to be less similar to the Muslims
  - Renamed Arabic (the pagan religion) to Wathanist
  - Renamed Slavic to Prabohnic (more on this in additions)
  
 Additions
  - Added Celtiberic and Gallic (Now France and Iberia can get in on the fun! Although they are pretty much different coloured druidics for now.)
  - Added Sudunic and Rodunic, splitting up the Slavic pagans into East, West and South, allowing for more centers of reformation to match up with the other groups. I named them after the supreme god for now, but if anyone comes up with something better I will likely change it.
    - This means that Prabohnic now has the same Expansion events, giving it 3 CoRs, hopefully this will counterbalance the crazy Romuva I've seen fairly often.
  - Made provinces that neighbour newly spawned CoRs more susceptical to the CoRs

  
Version 0.4

Bug Fixes
 - Stopped Hellenic centers trying to appear in Anatolia (different continent so it won't work, blame pdx)
 
Changes 

 - Renamed Suomenusko to Finnic. (It meant something around Finland Religion)
 - Split Suomenusko into Finnic in and around Finland and Uralic in the Urals
 - Split Old World and New World Pagans
	- Changed Animists in new world to Ritualist
 - Added ability to toggle off Cthulhu
 - Moved the Tengri resurgence zone from the Western Steppe to the Central Asian Steppe. Of course a player can still change regardless. 
	- It's just how the game mechanics work, if I could I would extend to the Central Asian Steppe rather then moving.
Misc	
 - Did a bunch of other things but because I'm less organised than even Draiocht I don't remember what they are... sorry
 - Changed province histories to only overwrite religion instead of all provincial information, using the technique discovered by Perry (unfortunately I killed Buryatia by accident here, but they are back in 0.5!)

Version 0.3

 Changes

  - Rebalanced religious spread to follow the spread of respective cultures more closely (Zalmoxian should appear in south Slavic provinces far less now for example)
  - Changed the Hellenic religion to only spawn in Greece, Thrace, The Aegean coastline and the Marmara Sea Coastline (yea those last bits should only have been on the European side)
  - Changed the Latin religion to be able to spawn all across Italy except for the Rome area because Papacy
  - Allowed Sunnis to convert to Hellenic for those wierdos who want to become Hellenic Ottomans

 Additions  
  - Added an event to force convert nations or have negative consequences
  - Options to toggle the different religions at the start of the game
  - Options to have the resurgence start in 10 or 50 years, along with the initial 100 years
  - Tengri Resurgence in the western steppe
