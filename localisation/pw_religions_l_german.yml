From this universal spirit comes each man, the Am, that accompanies his body until his death. Moreover, not only does the human being have his Am, as all living beings do. Only the wekufe (beings of dark magic and bad luck) have no spirit. In 1444 this religion can be found in and around the Patagonian region of South America."
