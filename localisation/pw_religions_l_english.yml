He acted as the intermediary between his people and the gods and was obligated to sustain the gods through rituals and offerings so that they could maintain order in the universe.

From this universal spirit comes each man, the Am, that accompanies his body until his death. Moreover, not only does the human being have his Am, as all living beings do. Only the wekufe (beings of dark magic and bad luck) have no spirit. In 1444 this religion can be found in and around the Patagonian region of South America."

 cathar:0 "Cathar"
 cathar_religion_desc:0 "Catharism is a dualist sect which arose in the early years of the 11th century and which found great success in southern France and northern Italy until the 14th century. While the origin of the word \"Cathar\" is still unknown, the sect identified two diametrically opposed forces or deities: the \"good\" God, depicted in the New Testament, who created the spirit; and the \"evil\" God, depicted in the Old Testament, who created all matter and was often associated with Satan. Due to the connection between material possession and the Devil, many Cathars adopted an ascetic lifestyle. Cathars were also unique due to their tolerance of women, including the ability for a woman to perform the \"consolamentum,\" one of the sacraments integral to Cathar theology. Cathars' beliefs were considered heretical by the Catholic Church, which declared the Albigensian Crusade against the Cathars in 1208, ultimately leading to the eradication of the sect by the mid-1300s."

 waldensian_religion_desc:0 "Founded in the late 12th century, Waldensians are followers of the teachings of Peter Vaudès, a spiritual leader from Lyon, France. Waldensians are anti-clerical, and advocate a return to vows of poverty coupled with the practice of lay preaching, or preaching by people not designated as members of the clergy. Waldensians, unlike other contemporary movements like the Cathars, survived for centuries after the initial foundation of their belief system, and are considered to be one of the primary forerunners of the Protestant Reformation."

 lollard_religion_desc:0 "Lollards are members of the movement which came to be known as Lollardy, a movement based originally on the teachings of John Wycliffe and which laid much of the groundwork for not just other reformers like Jan Hus but for the greater Protestant Reformation in total. Wycliffe and his peers believed not just in the use of the vernacular in scripture - indeed, Wycliffe oversaw the first translations of the Bible into Middle English - but also in the doctrine of \"sola scriptura\" which would later underpin Lutheranism and other Protestant denominations. Lollardy's advocacy for anti-clerical reform garnered support from the peasantry and many academics at Oxford and elsewhere throughout Great Britain as well as from some members of the English nobility, who saw the confiscation of church property as an attractive way to gain income from England's monasteries. However, Lollardy would also garner much opposition from the Crown: in 1401, the law known as \"De heretico comburendo\" equated heresy with sedition against the crown and allowed for the use of burning at the stake as punishment for convicted heretics. While Lollardy would exist in small pockets until the English Reformation, the sect was forced underground and its influence waned heavily until then."
